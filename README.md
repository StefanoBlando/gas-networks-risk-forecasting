# Gas Network Risk Forecasting

This project was developed during the **Hera Group Data Hackathon** and focuses on predicting gas leak risks across pipeline segments using real-world geospatial and operational data. The aim is to support predictive maintenance strategies and improve infrastructure safety.



## Project Goals

- Integrate geospatial, temporal, and operational features from gas distribution networks  
- Predict monthly leak occurrences at the subsystem (CODSISTEMA) level  
- Provide both a binary classifier (leak/no-leak) and a regression model (expected leak count)  
- Generate synthetic data to enhance training via **CTGAN** and **TimeGAN**

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset (not included) was provided by Hera Group for hackathon purposes and includes:

- **Pipeline characteristics**: geometry, materials, diameter, installation year  
- **Leak events**: timestamped gas leak reports linked to segments (`IDSAP`)  
- **Risk levels**: monthly risk score (0–100) per segment, from predictive models  

>  **Note**: Raw data files are proprietary and not included in this repository.

## Data Access

This project uses proprietary datasets provided by Hera Group for hackathon purposes only.  
To reproduce results, please request access from the organizers or use analogous public datasets.

##  Future Work

- Improving explainability (XAI) and causality estimation  
- Testing models on new years or broader regions  
- Incorporating weather and pressure sensors data
